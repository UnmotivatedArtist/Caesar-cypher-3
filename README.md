The journey from the first Caesar cipher to the current one was a... interesting experiance. The first round was just shifting every character possible all at once using an ASCII table, we eventually added some code that would keep spaces as spaces.
The second version we added the ability to shift everything into everthong else.
In version 3, we were able to solve without using teh shift.
